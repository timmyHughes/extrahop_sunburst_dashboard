# extrahop_sunburst_dashboard

couple Dashboards for ExtraHop and a couple linked Record Queries
1.) you'll have to edit the textbox widgets for the query IDs after you apply the bundle
but I'll explain later when I get time
2.) the Device IP vixibility dashboard is funky becuase if a 256 character limit ion the filter, 
but you can work around that kinda - in edit mode  so I put the filter you need in a textbox widget below that
